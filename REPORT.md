# Initialize Spring Project
Following the Spring Boot guide: Serving Web Content with Spring Boot, I initialized a new spring project with the thymeleaf dependancy and downloaded it to my computer. I then extracted the files into the Personal-Portfolio project folder that I cloned into my local documents.

# Create the AboutController

# Create the HTML files.
After the controller was created, I created both the index.html and greeting.html pages that were given in the tutorial. For the greeting.html page, I changed the name to about.html. With some of the slight modifications to the file naming, I tested my web page just as the tutorial described and had no issues.
